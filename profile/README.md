Food is one of the most important things for humans. In order to get enough nutrition supply, humans must get enough good quality food. But, there are still existing problems related to the food supply. One of them comes from the farmers' side that can't always be precise and fast enough to identify their crop conditions so they sometimes can't hinder themselves from getting a lack of quantity and quality of their harvest, which can lead to a lack of food supply. The other one comes from us. According to data published by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, in 2022, about 41.47% of overall national waste
comes from food leftovers [[1]](https://sipsn.menlhk.go.id/sipsn/public/data/sumber). Furthermore, about 39.95% of it comes from households, which is no other than ourselves. One type of food leftovers comes from fruits that are not suitable for consumption; usually because of already rotten conditions [[2]](https://waste4change.com/blog/jenis-sampah-organik-bukan-sekadar-sisa-makanan/). One of the reasons for that comes from a lack of human knowledge on recognizing their stored fruits' ripeness level. These problems need to be tackled with such a detection system that can make the farmers' and individuals' life easier so that we can together manage our food supply properly.

# Role Description 
## Machine Learning Engineer 
Machine Learning Engineer's main task is to do model development regarding image classification tasks on various objects that are related to plant crop disease, fruit ripeness, and vegetable ripeness cases. Several model development approaches like creating models from scratch, leveraging several transfer learning approaches, and doing image augmentation are used in order to get the best model for each object. The other responsibility is related to the model deployment part, where the Machine Learning Engineers need to save the models in the correct format and know how to use them so that they can be included in the API service that is created by the Backend Engineers.

## Cloud Engineer
The Cloud Engineer's responsibility is to design, implement, and manage cloud infrastructure and services used for the project implementation. Cloud Engineers work closely with cross-functional teams to understand requirements, architect scalable cloud solutions, and ensure the optimal performance, security, and availability of cloud-based systems.

## Backend Engineer
The main responsibility of a Backend Engineer is to design, develop, and maintain the server-side components and infrastructure of software applications. A Backend Engineer focuses on building the logic and functionality that powers the application, ensuring its stability, performance, and scalability.

## Android Developer
Android Developer's responsibility involves gathering the required libraries such as ImagePicker, implementing the UI design using Kotlin and Android Studio, and utilizing libraries like Retrofit and CameraX that can be used for API integration, data handling, and overall functionality of the application, which results in a seamless user experience and efficient communication with the server.

## UI/UX Designer
UI/UX Designer's responsibility is to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for digital products that provide an optimal user experience.

## Project Manager
The Project Manager's main task is to effectively plan, organize, and oversee the project implementation so that the project can be delivered on time, within budget, and meet the specified objectives with limited resources.
