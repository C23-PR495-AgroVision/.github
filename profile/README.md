# Background
Food is one of the most important things for humans. In order to get enough nutrition supply, humans must get enough good quality food. But, there are still existing problems related to the food supply. One of them comes from the farmers' side that can't always be precise and fast enough to identify their crop conditions so they sometimes can't hinder themselves from getting a lack of quantity and quality of their harvest, which can lead to a lack of food supply. The other one comes from us. According to data published by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, in 2022, about 41.47% of overall national waste
comes from food leftovers [1]. Furthermore, about 39.95% of it comes from households, which is no other than ourselves. One type of food leftovers comes from fruits that are not suitable for consumption; usually because of already rotten conditions [2]. One of the reasons for that comes from a lack of human knowledge on recognizing their stored fruits' ripeness level. These problems need to be tackled with such a detection system that can make the farmers' and individuals' life easier so that we can together manage our food supply properly.

## Job Description 
### Machine Learning Engineer 
Our task is to collect, review, and clean the open-source dataset we have gathered on plant diseases and fruit ripeness. We then proceed to conduct model training separately. We perform several experiments, such as building the model from scratch and utilizing transfer learning. Once we obtain the best models, they will be saved for deployment purposes.

### Cloud Engineer
Our task is to create an App Engine instance to host a cloud service specifically designed for training the model. We utilize object storage to store the dataset, implement a private API for image recognition, and integrate a third-party API for image classification. All of these steps are crucial to ensure the generation of accurate results for image classification.

### Mobile Developer
Our task involves designing the UI appearance in Figma, implementing the UI design using Kotlin and Android Studio, and utilizing libraries like Retrofit and CameraX. These libraries will enhance API integration, data handling, and overall functionality of the application, resulting in a seamless user experience and efficient communication with the server.
