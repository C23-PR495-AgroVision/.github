## Job Description 
### Machine Learning Engineer 
Our task is to collect, review, and clean the open-source dataset we have gathered on plant diseases and fruit ripeness. We then proceed to conduct model training separately. We perform several experiments, such as building the model from scratch and utilizing transfer learning. Once we obtain the best models, they will be saved for deployment purposes.

### Cloud Engineer
Our task is to create an App Engine instance to host a cloud service specifically designed for training the model. We utilize object storage to store the dataset, implement a private API for image recognition, and integrate a third-party API for image classification. All of these steps are crucial to ensure the generation of accurate results for image classification.

### Mobile Developer
Our task involves designing the UI appearance in Figma, gathering the required libraries such as ImagePicker, implementing the UI design using Kotlin and Android Studio, and integrating APIs with Retrofit, ViewModel, and LiveData. Finally, we store offline-accessible data, such as user information and detection history, in SQLite and Room.
