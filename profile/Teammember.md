Our team consists of three different divisions, each with its own tasks. The Machine Learning engineers, comprising three members, are responsible for collecting, reviewing, and cleaning our collected open-source dataset on plant diseases and fruit ripeness. They then proceed to train the models separately. The Machine Learning engineers conduct various experiments, such as building the models from scratch and utilizing transfer learning. Once they obtain the best models, they are saved for deployment purposes. The Cloud Engineer team consists of two members who are responsible for creating an App Engine instance to host a cloud service dedicated to training the model. They also utilize object storage to store the dataset, set up a private API for image recognition, and integrate a third-party API for image classification. All of these steps are crucial in order to generate accurate results for image classification. The Mobile Developer is responsible for designing the UI appearance using Figma, gathering the necessary libraries like ImagePicker, implementing the UI design using Kotlin and Android Studio, and integrating APIs with Retrofit, ViewModel, and LiveData. Additionally, the division stores offline-accessible data, such as user information and detection history, using SQLite and Room.
